# Competitive Programming Library
Algorithms and competitvie programming are inseparable. In this repository I tried to maintain library of algorithms and data structures that are regularly used in competitive programming. I use C++ for competing, thus almost every code here is in C++. I tried to keep codes as simple as possible and make sure that they work properly. Some tips are included. Some mistakes that I made during solving problems are included (this is a personal list). Throughout the library, it is assumed that all C++ standard headers are included already, and no need to write std:: before standard library classes/functions.
