Example. 2 out of 9 women and 2 out of 10 men recieved A in the morning class.
         6 out of 9 women and 9 out of 14 men recieved A in the afternoon class.
         a higher proportion of women recieved A in both classes but a lower proportion of women recieved A if classes were combined!
         The explanation is that the bulk of men are in afternoon class where it is easier to recieve A.
         This make it easier on average for men to recieve A.
