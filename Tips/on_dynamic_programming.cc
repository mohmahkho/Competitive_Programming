/*
one of the most important things in solving dynamic programming problems is 
defining dp well. for example :
dp[i] = number of good sequences ending at i or before i
these kind of definitions help you better undrestand what you are doing and
better set the base cases which is really important in dynamic programming problems
because if you don't set base cases you will end up with only 0s or WA.

Another thing that is important for solving a DP problem is to say "What is important?".
This question will help you figure out your DP state.
